# Code refactoring: HTML, CSS and commit to GItHub 

## My Task in the HTML 

1. I needed to make sure the webpage meets accessibility standards 
2. I did this by adding an appropriate title, "Marketing agency 
3. Changed H1 heading to read "Horiseon" simply. 
4. Application link one was not functioning correctly.
5. I added the id element in the first section to be the link functional. 
6. I added accessible alt attributes to all images. 

## My task in the CSS

* I joined all of the classes into one because i noticed a lot of dry (repeat codes). 
* I also allow each section to be active by adding a hover effect in the CSS file.
## Creating a repository 

* I went into my GitHub account and created a new repository named "Code-Refactor-02Homework 
* Then I uploaded all my files such as readme, HTML, and CSS
